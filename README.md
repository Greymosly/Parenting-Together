# Bottega Final Project

I created this project so that I could have one location to view my parenting schedule and allow other parties to view the calendar. It will allows all partied invovled with Imogenes life to see upcoming events for her and plan accordingly. The calendar syncs with my google calendar. Login is done through devcamp space provided by Bottega.
